# A Simple Game Toolkit

A personal game toolkit built on top of SFML with the primary overarching goals of the framework being to implement a game state manager, a comprehensive decent scene graph system, and a solid audio system with reasonable access to the datastream. This toolkit also provides a utility portion that assists in the creation of some file data structures such as texture maps, and 9patches.

## Components

The toolkit is split into 2 portions:

- Utility
- Framework

The Utility portion is a lightweight program that aids in producing some of the more commonly used file data structures by the framework. The framework itself is the part that provides the libraries and SFML implementation to allow for a smoother game development experience.
